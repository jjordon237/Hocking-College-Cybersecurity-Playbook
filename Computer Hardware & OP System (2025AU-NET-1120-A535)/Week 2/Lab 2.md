Lab 2: Installing RAM and a HD 
•	 Install/remove RAM and a storage device in a provided system or simulation.
•	Document steps with annotated photos/screenshots.
•	Submit lab sheet or annotated diagram via Blackboard.
Part 1: Steps for Installing a RAM Chip:
 
1)	Locate the RAM slots on the Motherboard and have all parts ready as well as make sure to wear antistatic wrist strap. 

 
2)	Find the two RAM slot levers on the left and right side of the RAM slot and push down to open. This allows the RAM slot to be ready to receive the new chip. 

 
3)	(Down) Orient the chip to the correct pin configuration, making sure the slots are aligned. 
 
4)	Lower the RAM Chip slowly into the slot. 
 
5)	Press down firmly with both thumbs on either side of the RAM chip till it clicks into place. You will hear the slot levers lock on either side of the RAM chip. 


Part 2: Steps for Installing a storage device 
1)	You must start by understanding if the drive/case you chose needs an adapter from a 2.5” solid state drive (SSD) to a 3.5” hard disk drive (HDD) or if your case has the holes needed.
  
2)	Position the hard drive so that the holes on the side align with the drive bay holes for easy installation. Make sure the interface and power connectors are facing towards the motherboard as the SATA cables will be coming from there to supply power and data transfer cables. 
 

3) Take your time in ensuring the holes align with the side of the HDD for safe installation before mounting to the case.  

4)	Secure with the screws making sure not to overtighten.  







Part 3: Installing an Optical Drive
1)	Step 1 is always take the front cover off the case to have access to the hole the optical drive (Blu-Ray-RE Recommended)   
2)	The case front panel could be held on by several clips, be sure not to break when taking off. 



3)	Place the optical drive in the case and position to align with the 5.25” drive bay opening screw holes on the case. 
 
4)	Insert the optical drive and screw into place. At this juncture, take care to installing the drive with the correct orientation so you do not have to either re-install it, or flip the tower over every time you needed to use the optical drive. 
 
Replace the front plate and enjoy building the rest of your new computer
