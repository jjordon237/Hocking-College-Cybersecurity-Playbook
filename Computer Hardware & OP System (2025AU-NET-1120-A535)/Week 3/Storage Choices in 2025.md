# NET-1120 • Week 03 • Storage Choices in 2025: HDD vs SSD vs SSHD
 
**Student:** James Jordon

## Purpose
This artifact demonstrates the various types of hard drives that can be purchased for your new desktop. There are three types of hard drives to choose from: a hard disk drive (HDD) that uses magnetic spinning wheel to store data, a solid-state drive (SSD) similar to a USB flash drive that does not utilize any moving parts and stores data via flash memory, and a solid-state hybrid drive (SSHD) that combines both to create two storage layers, a SSD layer that uses the flash memory (8 to 32 GB) used as a cache memory and a HDD layer and magnetic spinning disc to store data as it is more economically friendly per gigabyte to store large amounts of data.

## What I did
In building a new computer, you must choose what type of hard drive your computer will store its data in. Hard disk drives, as seen above, are cheap, slower, but the most cost effecient. Solid state hybrid drives combine a smaller HDD for the main storage and smaller SSD for cache memory. This allows a faster data transmission compared to the HDDs. You also have Solid State drives which are not the most cost-effecient as they are nearly twice the price per GB compared to HDDs, but store and access data at MUCH faster rates, as seen above.  
 
## Reflection
In terms of cost, the hard disk drive (HDD) will always win out. The older mechanical hard drives have dominated the hard drive market for their cheap, reliable disks. In terms of speed, the SSD will win out every time as it does not have moving parts and only requires reading the stored binary information on the flash memory used. The solid-state hybrid drive is a good middle-ground for cost-benefits where the HDD portion is cheaper and the SSD portion is smaller, and therefore cheaper than a straight SSD. If I were to build a new desktop, I would specifically purchase the HDD for large storage capacity and use it as my backup internal HDD and have a SSD for my main hard drive. The reason behind this is  I need a faster, high-performance hard drive that has less of a chance for it to fail. I have had hard disk drives fail on me and lose everything as backups were still in its pre-mainstream computing days. I have had HDDs fail in iPods, laptops, and even external hard drives. They do appear to be more finicky as they have more moving parts. They are also much slower than the faster SSDs. Samsung has created some amazing and very reasonable SSDs. For example, a SAMSUNG 870 QVO SATA III SSD 4TB 2.5" Internal Solid State Drive is currently on sale at https://a.co/d/fqDvLMp for $359.99 while a Toshiba X300 PRO 8TB High Workload Performance for Creative Professionals 3.5-Inch Internal Hard Drive is currently on sale at https://a.co/d/0f8UXFT  for $197.99. I, unfortunately, was unable to find a suitable SSHD that would be comparable.
