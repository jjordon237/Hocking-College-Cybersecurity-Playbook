# NET-1120 • Week 03 • Upgrade Proposal 
 
**Student:** James Jordon   
**Date:** 2025-09-10
 
## Purpose
Alex, a friend had just purchased an ASUS ROG Strix B850-F Gaming WiFi AMD AM5 B850-F ATX Motherboard and wanted help building it to include new CPU upgrade, RAM upgrades, storage upgrades, as well as completing a UEFI checklist to boot his new gaming set up. 
We then broke the list of upgrades down into a cheaper and more expensive option for each upgrade.

## Upgrades

**CPU Upgrade:** We focused on two cores for his gaming set up. First, we looked at a moderate AMD Ryzen 5 7600X 6-core 12-thread CPU for $178.51 plus tax off https://a.co/d/9j8M2ZB. This was a cheaper, but good processor for his uses that provided him with 6 cores, 4.7 Ghz clocking speeds, and 32 mb of L3 cache memory while only drawing 105W of power. This would be easier to cool. His other choice was the beefier AMD Ryzen 7 7700X 8-Core, 16-Thread Unlocked Desktop Processor that provided him with a stronger processor, boost speed of 5.4Ghz and 80Mb L3 cache memory instead of the 32 on the Ryzen 5 7600X. After much consideration as he needed the desktop not just for gaming, but used it for virtual machines, he spent the $264.41, on sale at https://a.co/d/dYz4NDg. 

**RAM Upgrade:** We then focused on his RAM needs. The board came standard with four (4) open DDR5 RAM slots with a maximum capability of 256 GB RAM. He wanted some flashy RAM and had a working budget of around $300. His choices boiled down to the G.SKILL Trident Z5 Neo RGB Series DDR5 RAM (AMD Expo) 64GB (2x32GB) at $254.99 plus tax (https://a.co/d/6q20dF1) and the CORSAIR VENGEANCE RGB DDR5 64GB (2x32GB) DDR5 5600MHz CL36 AMD EXPO RAM for $239.99 plus tax at (https://a.co/d/e7jyyhJ). After deliberation, he chose the G.Skill Trident due to its 6000MHz speeds and built for AMD CPUs. 

**Storage Upgrade:** And finally, Alex was torn between a solid-state drive and a hard disk drive. He looked at two separate 4 TB options, the Crucial T705 4TB PCIe Gen5 NVMe M.2 SSD with Heatsink- Up to 14,100 MB/s Internal Solid State Drive for $369.99 (https://a.co/d/gOyCk28) and the Seagate IronWolf Pro, 4 TB, Enterprise NAS Internal HDD –CMR 3.5 Inch, SATA 6 Gb/s, 7,200 RPM, 256 MB Cache for RAID Network Attached Storage for $129.99 (https://a.co/d/gaCQm5G). This was a difficult decision for him as the SSD was twice as fast, writing at 14.1 Gbps with the built-in heat sink. On the other hand, the cheaper, but slower Seagate Ironwolf supported a SATA 6 Gbps data upload speed. His new motherboard had four open M.2 NVMe slots, supporting PCLe 4.0 as well as 5.0. This tough decision led him to realizing the cheaper option also required another fan to run and chose the SSD. He plans on adding the HDD during his next phase of upgrades and additions. 

**UEFI Boot Checklist** When booting up his new gaming PC, we had to run the UEFI checklist to ensure all items were correctly installed and fix any discrepancies. 
  1) We entered UEFI BIOS Mode by tapping F2 and entered Advanced mode. 
  2) We checked the main tab to see his AMD Ryzen 7 7700X was installed, the Trident Z5 Neo Ram (64 GB) was installed correctly, and Storage showed the Crucial T705 SSD (PCIe Gen5) installed as well.
  3) We set up the corrected Boot settings ensuring we were not in Legacy (BOIS) mode and set up the order with the Crucial T705 SSD (PCIe Gen5) being the primary location. 
  4) We then set up the RAM enabling the AMD EXPO profile. This ensured it was compatible with the AMD Ryzen 7 installed.
  5) Optimizing the storage options, we set the NVMe Configuration to Gen 5, confirming the Crucial T705 set for Gen 5.
  6) We then enabled the security boot to allow for the Windows 11 Pro he purchased, using Windows UEFI Mode to install.
  7) We set up the Q-Fan Tuning through the UEFI to ensure the CPU fans were working optimally. With the additional heat sink built into the SSD, there was less likely a chance for thermal disruption.
  8) Using F10 function, we saved the changes, booted up and installed Windows 11 Pro. From there, we shut down the system and rebooted into the UEFI mode to check and ensure the boot functions were correctly in order as well as all hardware installed worked correctly.


 
## Reflection
This was a very rewarding opportunity to help my buddy achieve his goal of owning his own gaming PC after personal losses. His new ASUS ROG Strix was able to play games with ultra-high speeds, very little clipping issues, and all work functions. It was an honor to help him build it for a grand total of $889.97 plus tax for the parts.

*AI Use Note (if used): I used Sage (ChatGPT) to help build the computer in choosing what would fit the ASUS ROG motherboard as well as comnparing and contrasting the various products when we were pricing and building his new gaming PC. SAGE was also used to look up the UEFI boot up steps in order for practice.
