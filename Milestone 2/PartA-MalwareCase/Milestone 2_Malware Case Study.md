## Case Project 3-4: Banning Ransomware Payments

> Different state legislatures are now considering legislation that would ban any state or local government agencies from paying a ransom. The reasoning is that if the attackers know that a state or local government is prohibited from paying a ransom, then these entities will no longer be victims of attacks since the attackers know they will never be paid. It is also said that the laws would also decrease the total level of ransomware, since paying ransoms only encourages more of this malicious activity. Some have suggested that any ransomware payments by any business or organization should be deemed illegal. But will this actually stop ransomware? What would happen to those entities that are hit with ransomware and are unable to restore their systems from backups? Debate the pros and cons of banning ransomware payments and write a one-page paper about these two sides. What is your recommendation? Why?

**Response:**  
In my opinion, will ransomware stop if politicians stop allowing payments to hackers? **Absolutely not.** That does nothing for the root problem—how attackers first gained access (e.g., phishing or other intrusion methods). Attackers will find alternative ways to extort as long as vulnerabilities and poor practices remain.

Entities hit with ransomware and unable to restore from backups would have to revert to the **most recent clean backups**, hoping those backups are not compromised.

According to Tehrani (2023), **pros** of banning payments include:
- Reducing interruptions to **critical systems** (e.g., healthcare)
- Potentially **decreasing data leaks**
- **Lowering financial losses/downtime**
- **Limiting reputational damage**

**Cons** include:
- No guarantee data wasn’t **tampered with, partitioned, or deleted**
- Attackers may still **sell data** even after payment
- Payment can paint a **target** for future attacks

**Recommendation:**  
The only responsible approach is **prevention and resilience**:
- Maintain **dedicated, scanned backups** with **off-site copies**
- Deploy **Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR)**
- Provide **regular staff training** on phishing and cyber hygiene
- Maintain layered **network and physical security** controls

## Malware Type

**Instructions:** Identify and define the malware discussed in your selected Chapter 3 Case/Hands-On Project.

**Response:**  
We have chosen **ransomware** due to the high likelihood our target audience—**elderly Boomers in assisted living facilities**—may encounter it via **social engineering phishing scams**. If a phishing lure is opened, the ransomware is downloaded to the victim’s computer or phone and **locks access until a ransom is paid** (Tehrani, 2023).

## Infection Method & Symptoms

**Instructions:** Explain how the malware spreads and what symptoms appear on an infected system.

**Response:**  
The most common infection vector is **phishing** (emails, messages, or links that trick users). Beyond phishing, ransomware can be introduced through:
- **Drive-by downloads** from malicious or compromised sites  
- **Worm-like ransomware** (e.g., WannaCry) exploiting **unpatched vulnerabilities**  
- **Malvertising** (malicious ads)  
- **Insider threats**

**Symptoms** may include:
- Files becoming **inaccessible/encrypted**
- **Ransom notes** appearing on screen or in directories
- **System slowdowns** or abnormal processes
- Disabled **security tools** or blocked recovery attempts

## Evidence

**Instructions:** Insert notes, screenshots, or log excerpts collected during the guided lab.

**Response:**

## Defenses & Mitigations

**Instructions:** List at least three concrete defenses or countermeasures.

**Response:**  
According to Forbes (2021), **paying ransoms** is a bad idea—there’s **no guarantee** data is intact or won’t be re-locked. Practical defenses include:

1. **Backups & Recovery**
   - Maintain **versioned**, **scanned** backups with **on-site and off-site** copies  
   - Periodically **test restores**

2. **Preventive Controls**
   - **EDR** to detect and stop early-stage intrusions  
   - **Email security** (phishing filters, attachment sandboxing)  
   - **Patch management** to close exploitable vulnerabilities

3. **User Training & Policies**
   - Ongoing **phishing awareness** and **reporting workflows**  
   - **Least-privilege** access and MFA  
   - Incident **playbooks** for rapid isolation and recovery

## NetAcad Linkage

**Instructions:** Explain how this connects to NetAcad Modules 2.1–2.2 (Analyzing a Cyber Attack, Methods of Infiltration).

**Response:**  
As shown in Figure 2A-2, NetAcad defines **ransomware** as malware that **holds systems hostage** until ransom is paid. In practice, ransomware has **many modes of infection** and has disrupted entire cities (e.g., **Atlanta, GA**; Newman, 2018). Because phishing is a common delivery method, it’s critical that our target audience—**elderly individuals in assisted living**—learn to **identify and report** phishing attempts.
