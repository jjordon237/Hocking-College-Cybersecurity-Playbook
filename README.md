# Hocking College Cybersecurity Playbook

Welcome to the **Hocking College Cybersecurity Playbook**, created by James Jordon (jjordon237). This repository is designed to document and organize everything I‚Äôm learning in the Cybersecurity & Network Systems program at Hocking College. Whether you're a classmate, an instructor, or an industry professional, I hope you find value in this work.

## üîç Who Am I

Hi‚ÄîI'm **James Jordon**, a lifelong learner, family man, father, and husband based in Logan, Ohio. I believe you‚Äôre *never too old to learn*, and I‚Äôm committed to building my skills in cybersecurity. My GitHub profile is a reflection of that journey‚Äîone full of explorations, labs, challenges, and growth.

## üìö What This Playbook Is For

This playbook is intended to:

- Collect notes and best practices from class (NET-1111, CYBR-1100, etc.)
- Store reference materials: commands, diagrams, cheat sheets  
- Track labs, activities, and simulations  
- Organize security awareness content, protocols, incident response outlines  
- Demonstrate growth over time

| `about me.md` | Who I am, why I‚Äôm doing this, my background |
| `labs/` | Lab exercises and Packet Tracer files |
| `class_notes/` | Lecture notes, summaries (OSI model, malware, etc.) |
| `security_awareness/` | Phishing, malware, best practices, policies |
| `tools/` | Scripts, utilities, cheat sheets |
| `incident_response/` | Plans, flowcharts, playbooks for responding to security incidents |

## üõ† How to Use / Contribute

- If you're here for a resource, feel free to browse the folders or search for specific topics.  
- If you're a peer or instructor and want to contribute (suggest corrections, propose a new diagram, etc.), you can open a pull request.  
- I‚Äôll try to keep this repository updated with every new class / lab. Feedback always welcome.

## üåü Goals & Learning Objectives

By maintaining this playbook, I aim to:

1. Build a solid foundation in cybersecurity fundamentals (networking, malware, security tools, etc.).  
2. Hone my problem-solving skills through real lab work and simulations.  
3. Develop clear documentation‚Äîbecause if you can‚Äôt explain it, you haven‚Äôt mastered it.  
4. Prepare for certifications (e.g., Security+, Cisco-related) and real-world challenges.
