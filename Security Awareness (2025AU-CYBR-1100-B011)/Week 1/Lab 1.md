Lab 1.1 
•	Prompt recap Examine Data Breaches – Visual

•	In this project, you view the biggest data breaches resulting in stolen information through a visual format.

•	Open your web browser and enter the URL https://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/worlds-biggest-data-breaches-hacks/. (If you are no longer able to access the site through this web address, use a search engine to search for “Information Is Beautiful World’s Biggest Data Breaches.”)

•	This site will display a visual graphic of the data breaches, similar to Figure 1-6

•	World’s Biggest Data Breaches & Hacks webpage

•	Scroll down the page to view the data breaches by year. Note that the size of the breach is indicated by the size of the bubble.

•	Scroll back up to the top.

•	Hover over several of the bubbles to read a quick story of the breach.

•	Note the color of the bubbles that have an “Interesting Story.” Click one of the bubbles and read the story. When finished, close only this tab in your browser.

•	Click Filter to display the filter menu.

•	Under Sector, click retail to view those breaches related to the retail industry.

•	Click one of the bubbles and read the story.

•	Click Reset in the filter menu.

•	Select the sector finance.

•	Select the method poor security.

•	Click one of the bubbles and read the story.

•	Create your own filters to view different types of breaches. Does this graphic convey a compelling story of data breaches? This graphic shows just how much hackers are responsible for data breaches compared to other breaches, taking nearly ten times the amount of customer data in 2025 versus poor security and lost devices. Hackers were able to gain access to the National Database and steal 2.7 billion records of most Americans while the largest data breach due poor security lost 72,000 personal images from dating app Tea (Ha, 2025). 
•	How does this visualization help you with the understanding of threats? This visualization truly shows just how integral cybersecurity is to any corporation. Hackers have tried to gain access to most, if not all, major corporations and governmental entities. By investing in a strong cybersecurity program, your company will not waste 20 years’ worth of work to have one cybersecurity issue tarnish that forever. 
•	Close all windows.

•	Findings / Steps (bullets or short paragraphs) This quite visual graphic of data breaches tells a very compelling story of how poor security on behalf of mismanagement of information (think integrity in terms of CIA triad) has led to large sums of personal information were lost from 2015 to 2022. Many hundreds of millions of customers’ personal information were lost at that time due to poor handling by IT departments of companies allowing such poor management of data break down integrity of their company, though at a much slower rate. For example, in 2018, Twitter found an internal glitch that allowed all estimated 330 million users passwords were exposed. This created a very large shift into the integrity of which companies now store customers’ data to which we now see only a handful of companies in 2025 have had significant data breaches due to poor security, the largest of which is Coinbase that allowed 69,461 customers’ data to be stolen by cybercriminals (Gatlan, 2025).
While mismanagement can lead to significant losses of sensitive data, the larger threat by far and away is hackers actively working to breach systems to steal data. For example, in 2024, the National Public Data Records were hacked at which time over 2.7 Billion personal records with Social Security numbers were leaked (Abrams, 2024). So, be sure to go check your Transunion, Experian, and Equifax reports for any anomalies!

•	Takeaways (3 bullet points)

•	First, there must be a good cybersecurity department within your organization or corporation to combat as many security issues from both inside the system (poor security or lost devices) and outside the system (Hackers). 

•	Second, those hackers will at some point gain access to your records as its nigh on impossible to prevent every single form of attack all the time. 

•	Last, the federal government has lost most of your records in a gigantic data breach (Abrams, 2024), so be sure to watch your credit reports to make sure your identity was not stolen and used maliciously.
