## 🧩 Key Concepts
| Concept | Definition |
|:--|:--|
| Vulnerability | A weakness that could be exploited. |
| Firewall | Network filter controlling access. |
| IDS/IPS | Detects or prevents malicious behavior. |
| SIEM | Security log aggregation and alerting. |
| Patch Management | Updating software to close known holes. |

## 🧠 Reflection
This week shifted from **attacks to defenses**. We learned that scanning reveals flaws, but **consistent patching and verification** are what truly protect systems.

> “Visibility is protection.”
