Cybercrime evolves every single day — from AI-powered phishing and voice spoofing to brute-force password attacks.  
To stay ahead of the criminals, we must use a **layered defense strategy** coupled with a clear understanding of their tactics.  

After careful consideration, our cybersecurity team identified **five simple, actionable rules** that anyone can follow to stay safe online.

## 🔐 1. Hover-To-Reveal Every Link
Before clicking any link:
- Hover your mouse pointer over it to **reveal the true destination**.
- Confirm that the link **matches** the official website or sender.
- If in doubt, **don’t click**.
Example:
Visible Link: https://mybank.com/login
Real Link (hover shows): https://mybank-secure-login.ru/

**🚫 Never click — type the official address instead.**

**🧩 2. Keep All Devices Updated**
- Regularly install updates from your operating system and app providers. 
- Updates often contain critical security patches that fix vulnerabilities cybercriminals exploit. 
- Turn on Automatic Updates whenever possible. Restart your devices after updates to apply all changes.

**🕒 Staying one update behind can mean staying one step behind the hackers.**

**🔑 3. Use Strong Passphrases (NIST Standard)**
Follow the NIST Password Guidelines:
- Use a passphrase (three or more random words) instead of a short password.
- Minimum length: 12–16 characters.
- Avoid reuse across multiple sites.
-Examples:
Weak:  Spot1234
Strong:   Purple_Mountain_Coffee!94

**🔐 Password managers are highly recommended for storing unique credentials.**

**🧍‍♂️ 4. Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
 Always turn on MFA — especially for:
- Email, banking, and cloud accounts
- Social media and mobile logins
- Best options:
- Authenticator apps (Microsoft, Google, Duo). Their ease of use and integrated now into most devices and 
- Hardware security keys (YubiKey)
- Biometrics (fingerprint or facial ID)
- MFA is the single best defense against stolen passwords.

**🌐 5. Use VPNs and Virtual Machines for Testing**
When exploring new or third-party software:
- Use a VPN to protect your network identity.
- Run apps inside a Virtual Machine (VM) sandbox to isolate threats.

**🧠 Think of it as testing chemicals in a lab — never mix unknowns without protection.**

💬 Project Background
Our group — Luke Horner and James Jordon — developed an anti-phishing awareness campaign for senior citizens.
Why seniors? Because they’re statistically the most targeted demographic.

📊 According to Aydin (2025), nearly $5 billion was stolen from Boomers through phishing scams.

We created:

🧭 Summary: Layered Cyber Defense

| Layer      | Description                  | Example                |
| ---------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Awareness  | Recognizing phishing & scams | Hover before you click |
| Technical  | MFA, patches, VPNs           | Secure authentication  |
| Behavioral | Common-sense habits          | Think before you share |
| Backup     | Data redundancy              | Cloud + external drive |
