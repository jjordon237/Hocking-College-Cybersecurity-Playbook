# 🔒 Case Project 6-1: Privacy Survey — Smartphone Awareness
**Author:** James Jordon  
**Course:** CYBR 1100 — Security Awareness

## 🧠 Project Overview
This project explored how aware everyday smartphone users are of **privacy risks**, **data collection**, and **device security** practices.  
I created and administered a brief privacy survey to three peers to better understand their knowledge, behavior, and attitudes toward smartphone privacy.

## 📋 Survey Questions
Participants were asked the following three questions:

1. **Do you know that you can be tracked even with location turned off?**  
2. **Does your college keep and utilize your personal information when using their network system?**  
3. **What is the best method you use to keep your mobile device safe?**

## 💬 Participant Responses

| **Participant** | **Q1 — Location Tracking** | **Q2 — College Data Use** | **Q3 — Personal Security Method** |
|-----------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Student A** | “Yes I did.” | “Yes they do.” | “I switched the OS to Graphene for a better, more secure OS.” |
| **Student B** | “Yes.” | “I would assume.” | “I turn off Bluetooth when not using it.” |
| **Student C** | “Yeah. I would imagine, prolly so.” | “Oh, I don’t care about that.” | “They can break into my phone. There is no method.” |

## 🔍 Analysis & Observations

The responses show a **wide range of awareness and attitudes** toward smartphone privacy:

- **Student A** demonstrates **advanced privacy knowledge**, using **GrapheneOS**, a security-focused mobile operating system.  
  This reflects an understanding of how operating systems impact data collection and tracking.
  
- **Student B** applies **basic good security hygiene**, such as turning off Bluetooth when not in use — a simple but effective protection against local tracking and unauthorized connections.  

- **Student C**, however, takes a **nihilistic approach** (“I don’t care if they break in”).  
  This represents a common problem in privacy education — **complacency** due to a belief that personal data has little value or that surveillance is inevitable.  

Overall, **two out of three students** recognized that they could be tracked or monitored, yet only one actively implements robust defenses.  
The general perception seems to be that **data collection is constant and unavoidable**, which highlights a **gap between awareness and action**.

## 🧩 Key Takeaways

| **Insight** | **Description** |
|--------------|----------------|
| **1. Awareness ≠ Action** | Knowing about privacy risks does not guarantee proactive behavior. |
| **2. Institutional Data Collection** | Students generally believe colleges monitor and retain network data — and they’re likely correct. |
| **3. Complacency Risk** | One-third of respondents expressed indifference to privacy — a serious human factor concern. |
| **4. Security Education Works** | Exposure to cybersecurity coursework clearly improves privacy behaviors. |
| **5. Cultural Shift Needed** | The “I have nothing to hide” mindset still undermines collective digital safety. |

## 🔐 Recommendations

1. **Educate peers** about simple protective measures (MFA, updates, secure messaging).  
2. **Use privacy-respecting mobile OS options** when possible (GrapheneOS, CalyxOS).  
3. **Disable unnecessary permissions** (Bluetooth, microphone, location sharing).  
4. **Encrypt devices** and use **strong passphrases**.  
5. **Adopt a mindset of digital ownership** — treat your data like your money.  

> 🧠 *Privacy isn’t about hiding something — it’s about protecting your right to choose what to share.*
