# 🔐 Case Project 6-2 — The Current State of Privacy (U.S. Focus)
**Author:** James Jordon  
**Course:** CYBR 1100 — Security Awareness  
**Date:** September 29, 2025  

> **Brief:** Research current laws and regulations that address privacy. Are these adequate? Should more be done to protect users? What would you recommend?

## 🧭 Executive Summary
The United States **does not yet have a single comprehensive federal privacy law** protecting all consumers’ personal data. Instead, protections are **fragmented** across sector-specific federal rules (e.g., COPPA, HIPAA, GLBA) and a growing patchwork of **state privacy acts** (e.g., California’s CCPA/CPRA, Virginia’s VCDPA, Colorado’s CPA, Utah’s UCPA, Oregon and Texas laws).  This uneven landscape leaves many users without consistent rights or remedies and creates compliance complexity for organizations. A **uniform, bipartisan federal standard** could set clear, enforceable expectations for data collection, use, sharing, and security.

## 🏛️ U.S. Privacy Landscape (High Level)

### Federal (Sector-Specific)
- **COPPA** — Protects children under 13 by limiting data collection and targeted ads but does nothing for any adult consumer.  
- **HIPAA** — Governs protected health information across covered entities and associates.  
- **GLBA** — Requires financial institutions to safeguard consumer financial data and provide clear notices.  
> These laws **do not** create a universal privacy right for all consumers across all industries.  

### State Laws (Consumer Data Rights)
Multiple states have enacted broad consumer privacy statutes, including:
- **California** — CCPA/CPRA: **Access, delete, opt-out** of the sale/sharing of personal data.  
- **Virginia** — VCDPA: Similar rights framework, emphasizing consent/opt-out.  
- **Colorado, Utah, Oregon, Texas** — Recently passed laws modeled on earlier state acts.  
> This momentum shows **bipartisan** interest at the state level, but **no uniform federal baseline** yet. The American Data Privacy and Protection Act (ADPPA) is currently sitting in the now-closed offices of the Senate and is now considered a dead bill according to govtrack.us (n.d.). This creates a conundrum where there is no federal protection for a person’s data and how retail companies utilize or even sell it.

## ⚖️ Are Current Laws Adequate?
**Partially — but not comprehensively.**  
- Consumers get **some rights** depending on *where they live* and *which sector* handles their data.  
- Organizations navigate a **patchwork**, raising costs and confusion.  
- Without a federal baseline, **gaps** remain in transparency, consent, data minimization, retention limits, and consistent **breach notification** and **enforcement**.

## 🛠️ Recommendations (Policy & Practice)

### Policy: A Bipartisan Federal Privacy Standard
1. **Comprehensive Consumer Rights:** Access, correction, deletion, portability, and **opt-out** of targeted advertising and sale/sharing of data.  
2. **Data Minimization & Purpose Limitation:** Collect only what’s necessary; ban vague “just in case” collection.  
3. **Security by Default:** Mandate **encryption at rest/in transit**, strong key management, and regular security testing.  
4. **Consent & Transparency:** Clear notices, **plain-language** disclosures, and easy preference controls.  
5. **Sensitive Data Protections:** Extra safeguards for health, financial, location, biometrics, and children’s data.  
6. **Enforcement with Teeth:** Federal oversight **plus** state AG enforcement; **meaningful fines** scaled to revenue and violation severity; remedies for consumers.  
7. **Prohibit Data Brokering Abuses:** Restrict sale of personal data without explicit permission; require **registries** and audits for data brokers.  
8. **Breach Accountability:** National breach-notification timelines, incident reporting, and penalties for negligent safeguards.  
9. **Small-Business Onramps:** Scaled obligations and templates to support compliance without stifling innovation.  
10. **Interoperability:** Align with global norms to reduce friction for cross-border services.


> The federal government should set a uniform, enforceable standard, criminalize reckless data sales, and impose penalties (fines and temporary sales restrictions) for violations. Lobbying should also be illegalized as it provides a corporation with an unfair advantage over their consumers by blocking bipartisan laws such as ADPPA or by pushing through harmful laws that only benefit them. "People should not be afraid of the government. Governments should be afraid of their people," -V.
