# CYBR-1100 • Week 05 • Googling Yourself: The Good, Bad, and Ugly

## Purpose
This article demonstrates just how easy it is to locate yourself whilst Googling your name. While my name is extremely common to include a semi-famous politician, I was able to utilize the Voter Registration Records that showed my name, personal informatio such as mailing address, and personal family members. Evidence for such is seen in the first figure where my Voter Registration came up on the first hit in Google. The rest demonstrates the ease of finding my personal information from there. 
 
## Evidence

## What I did
I realized there was so much more information out on the internet about ourselves than previously realized. Although I was not able to locate any of my Social Media sites as they are private and do not come up in any searches, I was able to find my public record information for my voter registration records. This led me to see my personal information, potential traffic and criminal records, and other items from Truthfinder.com. I would not pay for a background check, but the legal public records alone were enough for any scammer to utilize the information for their benefit. This, coupled with information obtained through data breaches, could easily create the perfect storm to steal identities.  
 
## Reflection
I plan on deleting my Voter Registration card from the registry. I also plan on continuing to lock my data down through checking my credit reports from all three credit bureaus as well as monitoring my personal information on the internet. This truly opened my eyes to how unsecure our information is as well as how much is public knowledge.

## Most Absurd Laws of Ohio and Hocking County, Ohio

 In the early 1900s, Hocking county, like much of the surrounding Ohio countryside, was experiencing a revivial of reformative laws such as the good ole "dancing ban", Footloose-style. Apparently in the early 1900s, during a particulary boring and repentative reformation, the town of Logan, the county seat, banned dancing in all social settings and even imposed fines on -gasp- dancers, according to the Hocking County Post. It was soon repealed. 

 The state laws of Ohio range from the crazy such as horses having the right of way (a way of life out west) to the oddity of no fishing for whales on a Sunday. Would you please care to explain what species of whale lives in the Lake Erie? And no, I am not referring to walleye, pike, or muskie. But, by far the most humorous for the people of Ohio stems back to 1800s anti-cruelty to animals laws that forbids knowingly intoxicating the fish by giving it alcohol. I must tip my hat off to those brave souls that did not allow those people to coat their catfish with beer from the inside out before frying.
