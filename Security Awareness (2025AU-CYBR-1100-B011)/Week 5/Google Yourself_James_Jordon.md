**Student:** James Jordon

## Purpose
This article demonstrates just how easy it is to locate yourself whilst Googling your name. While my name is extremely common to include a semi-famous politician, I was able to utilize the Voter Registration Records that showed my name, personal informatio such as mailing address, and personal family members. Evidence for such is seen in the first figure where my Voter Registration came up on the first hit in Google. The rest demonstrates the ease of finding my personal information from there. 
 
## Evidence

 
## What I did
3–6 bullets summarizing your steps or decisions.
 
## Reflection
4–6 sentences on what you learned and what you’d improve next time.
