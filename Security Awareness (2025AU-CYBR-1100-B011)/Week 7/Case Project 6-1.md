# Case Project 6-1 — Survey about Privacy

**Student:** James Jordon  
**Course:** CYBR 1100 – Security Awareness  
**Week:** 7  
**Date:** 29 September 2025

> Create a short survey to administer to at least three of your friends about what they know regarding privacy as it relates to their smartphones. Include questions such as, “Do you know what location services are?” “What is a MAID?” “Are you aware of surveillance-based advertisers?” “Does your school monitor your actions and how do they use that information?” Write an analysis of their answers and perceptions about privacy. fileciteturn3file0

## Survey Questions Used

1. Do you know that you can be tracked even with location turned off?  
2. Does your college keep and utilize your personal information when using their network system?  
3. What is the best method you use to keep your mobile device safe? fileciteturn3file0

## Responses (Three Participants)

- **Student A:** “Yes I did. Yes they do. I switched the OS to Graphene for a better, more secure OS.”  
- **Student B:** “Yes. I would assume. I turn off Bluetooth when not using it.”  
- **Student C:** “Yeah. I would imagine, prolly so. Oh I don’t care about that. They can break into my phone. There is no method.” fileciteturn3file0

## Analysis

The responses demonstrate a spectrum of privacy postures:
- One participant exhibited a **nihilistic** stance toward device security, implying either indifference or reliance on external storage—both risky for identity and credit health.  
- The other two demonstrated **practical awareness**, citing a hardened OS (Graphene) and disabling Bluetooth to reduce the attack surface.  
- All three acknowledged that **institutional data collection** occurs routinely, reflecting a general awareness that personal data is gathered and monetized. fileciteturn3file0

### SAGE AI:

Sage AI was used as a reference to make sure my data was accurate. After writing said case projects, I utilized Sage to collage and code them into this document.
