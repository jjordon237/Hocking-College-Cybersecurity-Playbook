Case Project 6-2: Current State of Privacy

Regulators and government entities continue to pressure Apple and Google to make changes to their smartphones and user data provided by surveillance-based advertisers. Use the Internet to research current laws and regulations that address privacy. Are these adequate? Should more be done to protect users? What would you recommend? Write a one-page paper on your research.

At this current juncture, there is no federal law that protects an internet user's privacy in terms of their personal information. The American Data Privacy and Protection Act (ADPPA) is currently sitting in the now-closed offices of the Senate and is now considered a dead bill according to govtrack.us (n.d.). This creates a conundrum where there is no federal protection for a person's data and how retail companies utilize or even sell it. There are certain laws currently in use such as COPPA (protecting children under 13 by limiting data collection and targeted advertising), HIPPA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act), and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) which protects consumers' banking data and requires clear privacy notices given to all consumers in case of a data breach.

To combat this epidemic of data thievery and recklessness which have allowed billions of records to be stolen, lost, or divulged over the last ten years alone, some states such as California, Virginia, Utah, Colorado, Oregon and Texas have all begun or already created laws for consumer data protection online. This group of states proves that this is a bipartisan issue where the betterment of the American people and their data are again being used and ignored by the federal government and abused by corporations such as Google and Apple. For example, California's Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and its amendments allow individuals to access, delete, and opt-out of the sale of their personal data by corporations. Virginia, a typically Red state, has created a very similar law called the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (VCDPA).

I would recommend the federal government doing its job to protect the American people as consumers and their data has been taken advantage of by corporations. I believe there needs to be a split from corporations' desires for using and abusing the American people again. There needs to be a complete overhaul of checks and balances, where the government is there to serve the people against said corporations. The federal government should utilize a bipartisan bill to protect consumers that creates a certain standard for corporations to encrypt and store consumer data while making it illegal to sell data and a federal crime punishable with fines and locks on a corporation's ability to sell for a period of time.
