Case Project 6-3: History of Apple Privacy Protections

Research how Apple has changed how it protects user privacy on smartphones since 2010. Why have they made changes? Are these sufficient? Do Apple iPhones provide better privacy than Google Android devices? Why or why not? Write a one-page paper on your research.

Since 2010, Apple has made consumer data privacy a pillar of their iPhone foundation.  Appleosophy.com reported that there was no single event such as a major hack that drove Apple to invest so heavily in consumer privacy. Instead, they focused on consumer relations through protection of their data by creating more secure hardware such as Secure Enclave, using App Tracking Transparency since 2017, mail privacy protection, and iCloud advanced data protection. This has led to a shift in the cellular device economy as Android producers such as Samsung and Motorola write similar code.

The main reasons Apple has taken such a "No Backdoor" stance lies in the iOS 8 rollout which included default device encryption meaning only a users biometrics or passcode could unlock the phone for any reason. This led to a dispute with the FBI stating national security issues with such stances. By 2017, Apple began limits on web tracking through ITP or Intelligent Tracking Prevention. Other methods used include App Tracking Transparency (ATT), Advanced Data Protection for iCloud (ADP) and even Lockdown Mode in 2022.

These changes have defined Apple as the trusted brand for mobile security, going so far as to be ingrained in our society of being shunned if you don't have an iPhone. Apple phones, through their standard protocols, provide better protection than many Android phones as you have to provide cybersecurity for the Android. In recent years, Android 6.0 has bridged the gap between iPhone utilizing privacy dashboards, scooped storage, and runtime permissions, its business model of being ad-based operating system that is changed per Android manufacturer (LG versus Samsung for example). This has led to and will continue to lead to a fundamental divide between Apple's more expensive, secure, worse hardware-based iPhone and Android's more customizable, more inherently unsecure, better hardware-based Android phones.
