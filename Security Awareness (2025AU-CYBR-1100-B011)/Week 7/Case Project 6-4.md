Case Project 6-4: VPN Risks

Because VPNs use TLS instead of end-to-end encryption, the vendors behind the VPNs can store and then make available the list of websites that users access, which is the very opposite of the goals of a VPN. Research the history of VPNs that have compromised user security by storing this information and then making it available. Next, select three VPNs and carefully read the Terms of Service document. Do they specifically state that no user data will be stored on their servers? How could this be verified? Based on your research, which VPN provider would you choose? Why? Write a one-page paper on your research.

Virtual private networks (VPNs) have a complicated history of whether they completed the primary function of protecting users' data across the websites they peruse. However, this "no logs" claim many VPNs tout has been proven to be false. For example, in 2017 after a lengthy investigation, the FBI utilized PureVPN logs to solve a crime, showing the company retained the logs of its users, in clear violation of what it marketed. IPVanish, another private VPN company, gave detailed information to the Department of Homeland Security back in 2016, clearly showing the company again retained the user logs. Even into 2020, UFO VPN's negligence left a data breach of all the logs of their users to include passwords, site lists, and IP addresses. Bottom line, these VPNs have to be vetted and are only as good as what can be tested and proven.

SAGE AI helped me pick and study three specific VPNs. Mullvad, IVPN, and ExpressVPN were all tested. I read each terms of service and all state definitively that they do not store logs of user data of any kind. An article in 2023 showed Swedish Police had stormed the offices of Mullvad to find no data of its users to take stated the article. IVPN showed independent no-logs audit being completed in 2019, unfortunately out of date for my taste. The last choice, ExpressVPN, utilizes third party audits to show they have RAM-based servers that cannot retain any logs if their lives depended upon it. Their most recent test was completed in 2025 by the KPMG group. Another note, when Indian Parliament stated all VPNs working in India must have a log of users, ExpressVPN removed all its servers from the subcontinent.

In conclusion, I personally use ExpressVPN for not only standing up to bully laws shoved on them, but for actively showing they do not have the capability to retain our data logs with independent testing. If I use a company for any reason, I make sure that company is morally and ethically viable before giving my money to them. ExpressVPN consistently provides that.
