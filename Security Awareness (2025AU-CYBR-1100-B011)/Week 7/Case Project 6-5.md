Case Project 6-5: Privacy Best Practices

Review each of the suggested privacy best practices outlined in this module. Give each suggestion two scores, one based on the strength of the privacy (on a scale from 1–5) that it would provide and the other score (on a scale from A–F) of how likely you would be to follow this suggestion and why or why not. Then ask three of your friends to likewise score these suggestions. Finally, design at least three additional privacy best practices of your own. Write a one-page paper on what you have learned

Part 1: Reviewing Suggested Privacy Best Practices

Below are several common privacy best practices, scored for Privacy Strength (1–5) and Likelihood to Follow (A–F).(Scale: 1 = Weak privacy; 5 = Very strong privacy. A = Definitely follow; F = Would not follow.)

Privacy Best Practice

Privacy Strength (1–5)

Likelihood to Follow (A–F)

Explanation

1

Use strong, unique passwords for each account

5

A

I have now begun to use the new NIST guidelines for passphrases and not passwords as phrases are much more secure.

2

Limit what you share on social media

5

A

I actively avoid posting on social media like the plague. Not only do data breaches occur, but Meta and others abuse that data, allowing 3rd party use.

3

Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) on all accounts

5

A

This layer of security through the use of passkeys and biometrics to create the MFA is some of the strongest. I use it extensively.

4

Avoid using public Wi-Fi for sensitive transactions

4

C

I usually avoid this in public places such as restaurants due to my knowledge their Wi-Fi is unsecured. I will use the school's Wi-Fi as it is controlled through a firewall.

5

Regularly review privacy settings on devices and apps

4

C

I complete this task much less than I should as it is one of the simplest, but most time-consuming jobs of cybersecurity.

Person A is an influencer that believed the corporations and cell phone companies "took care of all that" and was blown away by learning just how unsecure her practices are. Person B is a professional that understood what cybersecurity meant and had very similar answers to myself, putting avoidance of public Wi-Fi higher than MFA. Person C had a working knowledge of cybersecurity but still used social media on a daily basis and did not see the issues with its continued use.

New Rules to Live By in this Digital Age

Avoid using Air pods or any smart microphone as they are extremely hackable to read not only your surroundings, but your brainwave functions. Apple has just put in the patent to use the Air pods to scan brain functionality.

Delete all old and outdated software as that can be a backdoor onto your computer.

Skip Google Chrome in and of itself. Use a better more secure search engine such as Duck Duck Go.
