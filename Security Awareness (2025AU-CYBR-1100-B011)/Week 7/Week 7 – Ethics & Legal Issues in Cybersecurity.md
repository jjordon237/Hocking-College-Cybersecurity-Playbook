🧠 Reflection — What We Learned

Week 7 challenged us to think beyond technology and into morality and law.
Key takeaways:

Ethics is the anchor of trust in cybersecurity.

Legal compliance sets the minimum standard; ethics demands we do more.

Transparency and accountability build public confidence in digital systems.

The intersection of AI and privacy requires constant ethical evaluation.

“Just because you can do it doesn’t mean you should.”
